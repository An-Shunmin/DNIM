DNIM: Deep-Sea Netting Intelligent Enhancement and Exposure Monitoring Using Bio-Vision
This project is an implementation of the following paper: DNIM: Deep-Sea Netting Intelligent Enhancement and Exposure Monitoring Using Bio-Vision. All experimental treatments in the paper are available from Google Cloud Drive at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O27qwTor7i2Qk4fLyreWZwtTZPyyqFd2/view?usp=share_link.
We propose two deep-sea net tank culture datasets: salmon bait-eating behavior dataset (SBBD) and salmon non-bait-eating behavior dataset (SNBD). You can get it from Google Cloud Drive at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kg8YaZltTJUXASvxYM84m4euIKAWGLoJ/view?usp=share_link.
